## About me
I'm a stay at home dad from Belgium, living in Japan. My hobbies are [making videos](https://youtube.com/@voylinsgamedevjourney), DIY, learning, and programming. My biggest goal at the moment is to make what I do, Youtube and programming, into my actual full time job. Still have a long way to go. My github name is [Voylin](https://github.com/voylin).
## About us
With 'us' I refer to the contributors, with many of them being on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BdbUf7VKYC). The contributors are an important part of making the projects we work on possible. From translators to programmers to testers.
## Our projects
### GoZen - A modular video editor
GoZen is our attempt on creating the best Linux video editor available for Linux. Fully open source, modular, and made with Godot and FFmpeg.
